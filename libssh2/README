libssh2 - SSH2 library
======================

libssh2 is a library implementing the SSH2 protocol, available under
the revised BSD license.

Generic installation instructions are in INSTALL.  Some ./configure
options deserve additional comments:

	* --enable-crypt-none

		The SSH2 Transport allows for unencrypted data
		transmission using the "none" cipher.  Because this is
		such a huge security hole, it is typically disabled on
		SSH2 implementations and is disabled in libssh2 by
		default as well.

		Enabling this option will allow for "none" as a
		negotiable method, however it still requires that the
		method be advertized by the remote end and that no
		more-preferable methods are available.

	* --enable-mac-none

		The SSH2 Transport also allows implementations to
		forego a message authentication code.  While this is
		less of a security risk than using a "none" cipher, it
		is still not recommended as disabling MAC hashes
		removes a layer of security.

		Enabling this option will allow for "none" as a
		negotiable method, however it still requires that the
		method be advertized by the remote end and that no
		more-preferable methods are available.

	* --disable-gex-new

		The diffie-hellman-group-exchange-sha1 (dh-gex) key
		exchange method originally defined an exchange
		negotiation using packet type 30 to request a
		generation pair based on a single target value.  Later
		refinement of dh-gex provided for range and target
		values.  By default libssh2 will use the newer range
		method.

		If you experience trouble connecting to an old SSH
		server using dh-gex, try this option to fallback on
		the older more reliable method.

  	* --with-libgcrypt
	* --with-libgcrypt-prefix=DIR

		libssh2 can use the Libgcrypt library
		(http://www.gnupg.org/) for cryptographic operations.

		Configure will attempt to locate Libgcrypt in the
		default location, but if you have installed it
		somewhere else, use the --with-libgrypt-prefix=DIR
		parameter.

	* --with-openssl=[DIR]

		libssh2 can use the OpenSSL library
		(http://www.openssl.org) for cryptographic operations.

		Configure will attempt to locate OpenSSL in a number
		of default locations:

			/usr/local/ssl
			/usr/local
			/usr
			/usr/local/openssl

		If your installation of OpenSSL is in another
		location, specify it here.

	* --with-libz=[DIR]

		If present, libssh2 will attempt to use the zlib (http://www.zlib.org)
		for payload compression, however zlib is not required.

		Configure will attempt to location a zlib installation
		in a number of default locations:

			/usr/local
			/usr
			/usr/local/libz
			/usr/libz
			/usr/local/zlib
			/usr/zlib

		If your installation of zlib is in another location,
		you may specify it here.

	* --enable-debug

		Will make the build use more pedantic and strict compiler
		options as well as enable the libssh2_trace() function (for
		showing debug traces).
