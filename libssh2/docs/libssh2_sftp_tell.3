.SH SYNOPSIS
#include <libssh2.h>
#include <libssh2_sftp.h>

libssh2_sftp_tell(LIBSSH2_SFTP_HANDLE *handle);

.SH DESCRIPTION
\fIhandle\fP - SFTP File Handle as returned by 
.BR libssh2_sftp_open(3)

that the SSH2 protocol does not have a notion of file pointers and that 
libssh2 implements this using a localized file pointer which is updated 
with each read/write call.
